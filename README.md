The first public release that I can find is when James Laska committed it to 
the [Cobbler](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler) source tree in 2009:

    commit be80abecb9dfcf529852c9536fb967e692316af7
    Author: James Laska <jlaska@redhat.com>
    Date:   Thu Feb 19 16:50:03 2009 -0500

        Adding zpxe.rexx and snippet to packaging

where it lived until S/390 support was removed from Cobbler in 2014.
